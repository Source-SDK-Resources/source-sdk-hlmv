# source-sdk-hlmv

The code for this repo is pulled from the old 2006 SDK. You can see the original here. 
https://github.com/Source-SDK-Archives/source-sdk-2006-ep1/tree/master/utils/hlmv

It has been made to work with SDK 2013 and VS 2022.
I have not and will not attempt to compile this with ancient versions of Visual Studio. [If you're still using old VS, I'd suggest checking out this repo](https://github.com/ozxybox/source-mp13-vs2022). 

Let me know if you make something cool with this!


Changes:
- Camera properly now rotates around the model, rather than the model rotating around the camera
- View Panning can now also be done via the Middle Mouse Button
- Zooming can now also be done via the Scroll Wheel
- The control panel can now be hidden via a button under the Options tab
